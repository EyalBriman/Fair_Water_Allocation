We study a model of fair division that is motivated by the fair distribution of water. In our basic setting, there is a central scarce, time-varying source of water that can  be stored (possibly partially); and several agents with different, time-varying demand of water. We consider several mechanisms for allocating water at each point in time,
study their properties, and design efficient algorithms that achieve these goals for most cases, based on the maximization of utilitarian, egalitarian or Nash social welfare.
In order to show the practical feasibility of our approach, we run our algorithms on simulated data as well as on simplified real data. The simulation results suggest (and perhaps confirm) that Nash social welfare is a sweet spot between efficiency and fairness.
